# (C)ompetitive (P)rogramming (P)roblems (CPP in C++)

This repository contains every solution to every problem I've solved since **July 19th, 2019**, as well as (hopefully) an analysis of each contest I participate. The main purpose is to keep a track of my skills and be more aware of what I have to get better at.
